# Sign-in

You can sign-in to your team from the web address of `https://domain.com/teamname`. 

There are several options for signing in to your team depending on how your System Administrator has configured your server. 

#### Email address and password sign-in

When enabled by your System Administrator, you can sign in using the combination of email address and password used to create your account. 

If you have forgotten your password, you should be able to reset it from the "I forgot my password" option on the sign-in screen, or contact your System Administrator if you need help resetting your password. 

#### GitLab Single-Sign-On (SSO) option 

When enabled by your System Administrator, you can sign-in using your GitLab account using a one-click sign-in option. GitLab SSO lets you create teams, create accounts on teams, and sign-in to teams using one username, email address, and password that works across everything on the server. 

#### Switching Teams

When you've used the same email address to sign-up and sign-in to multiple teams, you can switch among those teams using the main menu in any team site on the server. By default, devices remember which teams you have signed into for 30 days.

#### System Adminstrator Role

If your account in a given team has been given the System Administrator role, it has access to the System Console. The System Administrator role does not apply to accounts created in other teams using the same email address, since user accounts are unique to teams.

#### Logging Out

You can log out from the main menu, which is accessed by clicking the three dots in the top header on the left side of the screen. Clicking "Logout" logs you out of all teams that are signed-in and open in your browser.
