# Search

The search box in Mattermost brings back results from any channel of which you’re a member. No results are returned from channels where you are not a member - even if they are open channels.

#### Some things to know about search: 

- Multiple search terms are connected with “OR” by default. Typing in `Mattermost website` returns results containing “Mattermost” or “website”
- Use `from:` to find posts from specific users and `in:` to find posts in specific channels. For example: Searching `Mattermost in:town-square` only returns messages in Town Square that contain `Mattermost`
- Use quotes to return search results for exact terms. For example: Searching `"Mattermost website"` returns messages containing the entire phrase `"Mattermost website"` and not messages containing only `Mattermost` or `website`
- Use the `*` character for wildcard searches that match within words. For example: Searching for `rea*` brings back messages containing `reach`, `reason` and other words starting with `rea`
- Click on the **Jump** link on the right of a search result to view the post archive in the center channel

#### Limitations:

- Search in Mattermost uses the full text search features included in either a MySQL or Postgres database, which has some limitations
  - Special cases that are not supported in default full text search, such as searching for IP addresses like `10.100.200.101`, can be added in future as the search feature evolves
  - Two letter searches and common words like "this", "a" and "is" won't appear in search results
  - For searching in Chinese try adding * to the end of queries
