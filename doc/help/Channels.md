## Channel Types
Channels organize conversations across different topics. There are three types of channels: Public Channels, Private Groups, and Direct Messages.


#### Public Channels
Public Channels are open to everyone on a team. New team members are automatically a part of two Public Channels: Town Square and Off-Topic.  

#### Private Groups
Private Groups are for sensitive topics and are only visible to select team members. Any member of a Private Group can add additional members. Group members can choose to leave at any time, but only the group owner or team administrator can remove other members. 

#### Direct Messages
Direct Messages are for conversations between two team members. These conversations are only visible to the two team members involved.

## Managing Channels
Channels can be created, joined, renamed, left and deleted.

#### Creating a Channel
Create a new Public Channel or Private Group by selecting the **+** symbol next to the *Channels* or *Private Groups* header on the left hand side. To start a direct message thread, click **More** at the bottom of the *Direct Messages* list to view a list of team members you can message.

#### Joining a Channel
Click **More** at the bottom of the *Channels* list to view a list of Public Channels you can join. To join a Private Group you need to be added by a member of that group.

#### Renaming a Channel
Click the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then click **Rename Channel**. Channel owners can rename the Public Channels or Private Groups they’ve created. Team and System Administrators can rename any channel or group.

#### Leaving a Channel
Click the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then click **Leave Channel**. Any team member who leaves a Private Group must be added back by a group member if they wish to rejoin. Team members will not receive mention notifications from channels of which they are not members.

#### Deleting a Channel
Click the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then click **Delete Channel**. Channel owners can delete the Public Channels or Private Groups they’ve created. Team and System Administrators can delete any channel or group.

## Channel Settings
Notification preferences, channel header, and channel purpose are customizable for each channel.

#### Notification Preferences
By default, the desktop notification preference assigned in *Account Settings* is used for all channels. To customize the desktop notification preference for each channel, click the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then click **Notification Preferences > Send Desktop Notifications**. Customize what activity causes the channel name to be bolded by accessing the channel name drop-down menu, then click **Notification Preferences > Mark Channel Unread**.

#### Channel Header
The header is the text that appears next to the channel name at the top of the screen. It can be used to summarize the channel topic or provide links to frequently accessed documents. Any channel member can set the channel header by clicking the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then click  **Set Channel Header**.

#### Channel Purpose
This text appears in the channel list in the *More…* menu and helps others decide whether to join. Any channel member can set the channel purpose by clicking the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then click  **Set Channel Purpose**.
